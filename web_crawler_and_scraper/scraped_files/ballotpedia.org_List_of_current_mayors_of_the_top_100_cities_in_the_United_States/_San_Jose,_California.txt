<p>The city of <a>San Jose, California</a>, held <a>nonpartisan</a> elections for <b>mayor and city council</b> on November 4, 2014. A primary election took place on June 3, 2014. In any race where a candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote, they were declared elected and were not required to run on November 4. This happened in District 5, where <a>Magdalena Carrasco</a> defeated incumbent <a>Xavier Campos</a>, and District 9, where incumbent <a>Donald Rocha</a> defeated <a>Lois Wilco-Owens</a>.
</p><p>In total, six of San Jose's eleven council seats, including the mayor's, were scheduled for elections in November 2014. But due to outright primary victories in districts 5 and 9 in June, only four seats were up for election in the November 4 general elections. These included the mayor and districts 1, 3 and 7. All four were open seats, meaning that no incumbent ran for re-election.

<h2><span>Budget</span></h2>
<p>The city's budget process operates by fiscal years running from July 1 to June 30 of the next year. The city charter gives responsibility for drafting a proposed budget to the city manager. The mayor also delivers an annual budget message outlining a set of fiscal priorities. The city council is responsible for adopting the budget and is required to hold a public hearing prior to adoption. The city is required by state law to maintain a balanced budget.
</p>
<h3><span>Fiscally standardized cities data</span></h3>
<p>The fiscally standardized cities (FiSC) data below was compiled by the <a>Lincoln Institute of Land Policy</a> to make municipal budgets comparable across cities in the United States.
</p>
<div><table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>“
</td>
<td>
<p>FiSCs are constructed by adding revenues and expenditures of each central city municipal government to a portion of the revenues and expenditures of overlying governments, including counties, independent school districts, and special districts. The allocations to FiSCs are estimates of the revenues collected from and services provided to central city residents and businesses by these overlying independent governments. Thus FiSCs provides a full picture of revenues raised from city residents and businesses and spending on their behalf, whether done by the city government or a separate overlying government.

<p>In July 2015, the <i>Movement Advancement Project</i> described San Jose, California, as a city or county that prohibited discrimination in employment on the basis of gender identity via ordinances that apply to public and
private employers. At that time, a total of <b>71 of <a>America's largest 100</a> cities</b> prohibited private employers from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation, while <b>69 of those cities</b> also prohibited discrimination based on gender identity. This did not include those jurisdictions that prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity for government employees.
</p><p>Nondiscrimination laws can cover a variety of areas, including public employment, private employment, housing, and public accommodations. Such laws may be enacted at the state, county, or city level.
