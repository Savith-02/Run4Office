<div> <span>A complete independent Audit of the City of Austin.  The recently passed budget of 5.9 billion is totally out of control.  How do the taxpayers / shareholders knows where the  money is actually going?  An external audit would be accomplished over a five year time line.
<p>Each year a large department like water, power or transportation and several smaller departments would be audited.  The next year the same to different departments.  Lessons from those audits would be implemented in departments and those that still need to be audited that can implement portions.
This would be a continuous process and evaluated until ALL departments, including boards and commission are audited.
Money for these audits would be in the yearly budget.There is a lack of transparency and accountability to the taxpayers of Austin.  There is a high level of mistrust among the citizens of this council and staff.  Recent lawsuits against the city proves they believe they are above the law and not accountable the citizens.  Council passes ordinances that violates state laws and have been sued for such behaviors.
Recently, council violated the Texas Open Meeting Act regarding the handling of changes to the city charter.
The city was sued again and found they violated the rules.  When will it stop?
</p>
Citizens deserve better.Safety - We need a police contract.  When there is an emergency situation, we need to make sure there is someone to respond.  We need to make sure we have enough emergency staff to respond.  We need to ensure that we have enough police, firefighters, EMS and call center employees to respond to the needs of the citizens.</span> </div>

<div> <span>Building a Stronger Community Through Good Jobs and Fair Wages
Doug's commitment is to create pathways to *good jobs* for everyone in our community. He believes that investing in education, workforce training, and adult development programs will equip both young people and underemployed adults with the skills needed for today’s economy. Doug is committed to supporting living wage initiatives, unions, and accessible childcare, transforming low-wage work into meaningful, secure jobs. Additionally, when public funds support private enterprises, he insists on living wages, benefits, career growth, and local hiring to ensure every investment directly benefits our community and creates long-term prosperity.Doug's commitment to affordable housing focuses on meaningful, accessible solutions for all Austinites. He will prioritize deeply affordable housing options, targeting households earning below 30% and 50% of the Median Family Income. This includes expanded mortgage, down payment, and rental assistance programs, alongside loans for Accessory Dwelling Units  to support low- and moderate-income residents. He will limit the impact of institutional and private investors who dominate local real estate, pushing homeownership out of reach for families. Recent land use code updates will be implemented with families—not investors—in mind. Additionally, he’ll build on successful permanent supportive housing initiatives and enhance our shelter.Doug's commitment to community safety prioritizes fair pay, accountability, and unity. By ensuring our public safety officers are competitively compensated and supported with contracts, we can attract and retain skilled professionals dedicated to serving Austin. He’ll recruit from Austin’s diverse communities and continue strengthening training and community policing practices that foster trust and collaboration. With nearly 80% of voters backing the Austin Police Oversight Act, Doug is committed to transparency and accountability. Moreover, by investing in social services that uplift individuals and families, he aims to create a safer, more vibrant Austin for all.</span> </div>

<div> <span>We must address Austin's high cost of living and income inequality, and take real measures to protect and produce truly affordable housing and protecting our quality of life. Our current administration has put deals with developers before the public, and recent policies have no on-site affordability requirements nor protection of existing affordable housing and the people who live in it. We need policies and funding allocations that create real housing opportunities for those with low and moderate incomes. I have a track record of collaborating with developers and neighbors to create hundreds of new units of truly affordable housing, and protecting the rights of tenants and homeowners as we negotiate new and sustainable development.We must update our critical infrastructure—including power and water—to insure  our future quality of life as we grow and weather becomes more extreme. Instead of wasting tax dollars on expensive out-of-town consultants,  we can instead address high rates, increase reliability, transition to cleaner energy, and protect our water supply by implementing recommendations from city staff, commissioners, and advocates. We can leverage and bring back utility elections to take control over our local public utilities. This administration, under the mayor's leadership, has attempted to permanently remove our ability to vote on our utilities; I'd bring back these elections and champion cost effective and sustainable solutions.Austinites have more in common than in disagreement, and effectie governance can get us out of the divisive courtroom battles and all-day divided hearings we have gotten caught up in for year. Austin can once again be a beacon of creativity and innovation. This intergenerational, multicultural, politically and geographically diverse campaign is representative of inclusivity and common sense. As mayor, I pledge to work with all Austinites, including and especially across differences in opinion, to craft solutions that lower our costs and improve our quality of life.</span> </div>

<div> <span>The lack of the City of Austin in providing and  maintaining our infrastructure.  This counts for power, water and roads.
<p>The City of Austin wants to get out of the Fayette Power plant by 2029.  Yet has not explained how to replace the kilowatt hours needed.  Wind does not always blow and the sun is only out so many hours of the day.
How will they provide AFFORDABLE electricity to the owners of Austin Energy.   2029 is five years away.  Timeline to build a power plant is longer than that.
</p>
Water - It is reported Austin waterlines leaks 7 BILLION gallons a year.  WHY?  Water is a precious commodity and should not be wasted.  Yet where is the plan to replace or repair the existing system.</span> </div>

I am from austin and have worked with very diverse communities here all over the city for the past twenty years. I bring useful energy but also a lot of intergenerational history to the work.And I have a lot of knowledge about municipal issues. I have the ability to connect with communities North, South, East, and West. I can end a lot of the division currently keeping a choke hold on progress at the municipal level, by bringing people from across the political spectrum, shared values and priorities for our municipal issues. I have a proven track record of getting things done, both at city hall and in the community and I would open the doors to technical experts both inside the city and outside within the communty.</span> </div>

<div> <span>Set the agenda and frame the conversation: this is the most important role of the mayor in council, work sessions and meetings. I believe that I could bring about an entirely different kind of negotiation and creative space with the current council, let alone a future council. There is so much pressure to go along to get along with the current mayor and I can see it stifling many of the creation native initiatives and critical eye of our council members. Spending is at an all time high, but public interest doesn't have much space for dialogue, and this is something we could significantly change.
The mayor also sets the tone with the city manager and has a strong working relationship. Of all of the candidates in this race, I have the closest working relationship with dozens of city departments. At nearly every level of government, we could reduce costs and increase efficiency by listening to some of our frontline and middle management leaders and community advocates. We need leadership that prioritizes basic services and equity in infrastructural updates and social programs. There are so many opportunities to leverage our local expenditures with private and federal dollars.</span> </div>

It means that this person takes a pledge to live a life of service to the city, putting personal interests aside in the general interest of the well being of our public. That means that this person will play a role in the history of our city, speak, and act on behalf of nearly one million people. It means that this position is one of great honor and requires deep listening to the constituents of Austin and a continuous "growing edge" of learning and improvement.</span> </div>

<div> <span>The mayor's top priority should be setting an agenda that addresses all of the critical issues that need to be discussed in the public arena with respect to our basic services and city governance.
The mayor also serves a role of listening to the public and influencing the agenda accordingly. I would go in with an open mind, but I do know that some of our top priorities are securing and updating outdated infrastructure, especially in anticipation of extreme weather advance which are increasingly frequent. I would also immediately assess what we can fix in our land development code to better incentivize affordability and responsible development that reduces pressure on our local power grid and conserves water.</span> </div>

<div> <span>The land and the unique people it attracts are by the most special things about this place. Some of my ancestors knew how special this place was over two thousand years ago when they sketched a map of all of the unique water holes in central texas, on a petroglyph outside of Comstock, Texas. There have been Tonkawa and Apache, Caddo and Cuahuilteca, eventually Comanche and Mexicans (and most of these are names given by Anglo settlers) and throughout, it has been clear that this place is special to many people and has been for as long as people have been roaming this area. Farmers, creatives, students, educators, entrepreneurs, government workers, and more have been attracted to this place for generations, and they continue to be attracted here. If austin protects our environment, affordability, and creative culture, we will continue to thrive economically and attract investment.</span> </div>

Et regularly with the police chief and the police union and to encourage public dialogue that brings up areas of concern and opportunity from all sides of each issue. Though we are settling a multi-year contract for a period of up to 5 years. I still think we can check-in periodically with our police department annually or more frequently, creating space for public meetings to address public safety issues together with community and staff at the table.</span> </div>

<div> <span>They are critical to efficacious, policy and implementation. This is one of the greatest weaknesses of our current administration and time of governance in Austin, Texas. Never have I seen six Texas Open Meetings Act violations in two years plus two additional lawsuits having to do with an unimplemented police accountability referendum and miss managed funding for public transit. On the contrary, we have so many opportunities to leverage our local investments and deliver results to the people of Austin. With regard to transit affordable housing, climate proved, infrastructure, meaning a reliable power and water supply and holistic solutions to our public safety and homelessness crisis. The answers and successful models are in front of us. I have worked shoulder to shoulder with austinites all over the city, to produce hundreds of new units of affordable housing, improve quality of life around neighborhoods and schools, reduce crime, support real affordable child care, and much more. We need a mayor who will secure our basic services, prioritize community driven solutions, and ensure responsible spending in our public investments.</span> </div>

<p>A complete independent Audit of the City of Austin.  The recently passed budget of 5.9 billion is totally out of control.  How do the taxpayers / shareholders knows where the  money is actually going?  An external audit would be accomplished over a five year time line.
Each year a large department like water, power or transportation and several smaller departments would be audited.  The next year the same to different departments.  Lessons from those audits would be implemented in departments and those that still need to be audited that can implement portions.
This would be a continuous process and evaluated until ALL departments, including boards and commission are audited.
Money for these audits would be in the yearly budget.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>There is a lack of transparency and accountability to the taxpayers of Austin.  There is a high level of mistrust among the citizens of this council and staff.  Recent lawsuits against the city proves they believe they are above the law and not accountable the citizens.  Council passes ordinances that violates state laws and have been sued for such behaviors.
Recently, council violated the Texas Open Meeting Act regarding the handling of changes to the city charter.
The city was sued again and found they violated the rules.  When will it stop?
Citizens deserve better.</p>

<p>Building a Stronger Community Through Good Jobs and Fair Wages
Doug's commitment is to create pathways to *good jobs* for everyone in our community. He believes that investing in education, workforce training, and adult development programs will equip both young people and underemployed adults with the skills needed for today’s economy. Doug is committed to supporting living wage initiatives, unions, and accessible childcare, transforming low-wage work into meaningful, secure jobs. Additionally, when public funds support private enterprises, he insists on living wages, benefits, career growth, and local hiring to ensure every investment directly benefits our community and creates long-term prosperity.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Doug's commitment to affordable housing focuses on meaningful, accessible solutions for all Austinites. He will prioritize deeply affordable housing options, targeting households earning below 30% and 50% of the Median Family Income. This includes expanded mortgage, down payment, and rental assistance programs, alongside loans for Accessory Dwelling Units  to support low- and moderate-income residents. He will limit the impact of institutional and private investors who dominate local real estate, pushing homeownership out of reach for families. Recent land use code updates will be implemented with families—not investors—in mind. Additionally, he’ll build on successful permanent supportive housing initiatives and enhance our shelter.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Doug's commitment to community safety prioritizes fair pay, accountability, and unity. By ensuring our public safety officers are competitively compensated and supported with contracts, we can attract and retain skilled professionals dedicated to serving Austin. He’ll recruit from Austin’s diverse communities and continue strengthening training and community policing practices that foster trust and collaboration. With nearly 80% of voters backing the Austin Police Oversight Act, Doug is committed to transparency and accountability. Moreover, by investing in social services that uplift individuals and families, he aims to create a safer, more vibrant Austin for all.</p>

<p><span><a><b>Submitted Biography</b></a>: </span><span> "I am a second generation community organizer, nonprofit leader, and former city commissioner from Austin, Texas. I am running to bring new, accountable, and community-driven leadership to our local governance, learning the lessons of our past to adapt and reinvent Austin for the future without losing our values and what we love.
I bring a wealth of knowledge of municipal issues, a diverse network of connections from across the city, and broad relationships with existing city staff across many departments. Most importantly, I have a track record of bringing people together and listening to those directly impacted on multiple side of an issue, to craft sustainable solutions. I have worked with communities and the City of Austin to leverage tens of millions of dollars and make policy changes to support our housing, childcare systems, infrastructure, and basic services.
I am running for mayor because Austin deserves more transparent and better use of our spending for important services like public transportation, public safety, updated infrastructure that withstands the extreme weather ahead,  and the protection and production of truly affordable housing.  We've seen six violations of the Open Meetings Act and multiple lawsuits over police accountability and use of funds for public transit. It's time for transparent governance that leverages the expertise, entrepreneurial spirit, and creativity of our population. We have tremendous challenges and opportunities ahead." </span></p>

<div>
<p>We must address Austin's high cost of living and income inequality, and take real measures to protect and produce truly affordable housing and protecting our quality of life. Our current administration has put deals with developers before the public, and recent policies have no on-site affordability requirements nor protection of existing affordable housing and the people who live in it. We need policies and funding allocations that create real housing opportunities for those with low and moderate incomes. I have a track record of collaborating with developers and neighbors to create hundreds of new units of truly affordable housing, and protecting the rights of tenants and homeowners as we negotiate new and sustainable development.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We must update our critical infrastructure—including power and water—to insure  our future quality of life as we grow and weather becomes more extreme. Instead of wasting tax dollars on expensive out-of-town consultants,  we can instead address high rates, increase reliability, transition to cleaner energy, and protect our water supply by implementing recommendations from city staff, commissioners, and advocates. We can leverage and bring back utility elections to take control over our local public utilities. This administration, under the mayor's leadership, has attempted to permanently remove our ability to vote on our utilities; I'd bring back these elections and champion cost effective and sustainable solutions.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Austinites have more in common than in disagreement, and effectie governance can get us out of the divisive courtroom battles and all-day divided hearings we have gotten caught up in for year. Austin can once again be a beacon of creativity and innovation. This intergenerational, multicultural, politically and geographically diverse campaign is representative of inclusivity and common sense. As mayor, I pledge to work with all Austinites, including and especially across differences in opinion, to craft solutions that lower our costs and improve our quality of life.</p>
