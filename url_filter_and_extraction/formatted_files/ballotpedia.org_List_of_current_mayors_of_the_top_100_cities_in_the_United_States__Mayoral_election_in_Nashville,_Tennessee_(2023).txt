September 14, 2023, runoff election for mayor of<a>Nashville, Tennessee</a>. Incumbent Mayor<a>John Cooper</a>(D) did not seek re-election, making him the first Nashville mayor who served a full term in office to not seek re-election since 1991.</p><p>Although municipal elections in Nashville were officially nonpartisan, both candidates had political affiliations. O'Connell, who represented District 19 on the Nashville Metro Council, was a Democrat. Rolli, a former political strategist who was a staffer for Govs.<a>Bill Haslam</a>(R) and<a>Lamar Alexander</a>(R), was a Republican.</p><p>O'Connell and Rolli had advanced from a field of 12 candidates in the city's<a>nonpartisan general election</a>on Aug. 3, 2023, with O'Connell finishing first and Rolli placing second.<b><a>Click here</a></b>to read more about the general election.</p><p>O'Connell received 27% of the vote in the Aug. 3 general election.<i>Axios Nashville'</i>s Nate Rau wrote that O'Connell "overcame substantial campaign disadvantages to storm into first place in a crowded general election field...he sold voters on a progressive vision for the city and highlighted his vote against the $2.1 billion Titans stadium deal as proof of his commitment to controlling development growth." Before the general election, O'Connell told<i>The Tennessean</i>that his top priorities were improving basic governmental service such as trash pickup and filling potholes, building a better transportation network, and improving the trust residents have in city government.</p><p>Rolli received 20% of the vote in the first round of voting.<i>Axios Nashville'</i>s Rau wrote that Rolli "campaigned on addressing crime, keeping taxes low and pressing Metro Nashville Public Schools for improvement. She sold voters on her conservative bona fides by touting her resume." Before the general election, Rolli told<i>The Tennessean</i>that her top priorities were to ensure that all first graders in the city could read, improving public safety, not increasing taxes, and building a better relationship with the state to address regional issues such as transit and homelessness.</p><p>After reviewing voting data from the general election,<i>The Tennessean'</i>s Cassandra Stephenson wrote that "O'Connell-won precincts largely correlate to Davidson County's most populated districts" and "Rolli brought in the most votes in...areas that have historically netted support for candidates with conservative policy views." Stephenson also wrote that the "O'Connell-Rolli matchup mirrors the 2015 race between Megan Barry and David Fox (who now serves as Rolli's treasurer and campaign manager)." That year, Barry received 23.5% and Fox received 22.8% in the general election from a seven-candidate field. Barry defeated Fox in the runoff, 55% to 45%.</p><p><a>Matt Wiltshire</a>, who finished third in the general election with 17% of the vote, endorsed O'Connell on Aug. 14. State Sens.<a>Jeff Yarbro</a>(D) and<a>Heidi Campbell</a>(D)—who finished fourth and fifth, respectively—endorsed O'Connell on Aug. 9 and 10. Former Nashville school board member Fran Bush, who finished 11th in the general election, endorsed Rolli on Aug. 10.</p><p>As a result of the election, O'Connell became Nashville's fourth mayor in five years.<a>Megan Barry</a>resigned in March 2018 after pleading guilty to felony theft of property. After Barry's resignation, Vice Mayor<a>David Briley</a>assumed office and won a special election to retain the office in Aug. 2018. In the<a>2019 regular mayoral election</a>, Cooper defeated Briley.</p><p><i>The Tennessean</i>invited all mayoral candidates to complete a questionnaire on specific policy topics.

Danielewski is one of my absolute favorite books. I read it while recovering from an unexpected surgery, which occurred before I was vaccinated against COVID about a year into the pandemic.

Given the recent failure of a legislative sidewalk policy in the court system, we will need to overhaul our approach to having our development community more meaningfully partner in delivery of sidewalks.</span></div><div></div><div><p><span><a>Freddie O'Connell</a><span>(Nonpartisan)</span></p></div><div><span>We have made strong investments in recent years in police personnel, equipment, technology, and facilities.

We need to revisit it to incorporate lessons learned. We will probably need to significantly revise our zoning code, which has not kept up with community preferences for design standards. One of the best ways we can prevent displacement is by helping elderly Nashvilians and disabled veterans take advantage of property tax freeze and relief programs.</span></div><div></div><div><p><span><a>Freddie O'Connell</a><span>(Nonpartisan)</span></p></div><div><span>Many parts of downtown as a whole are healthy, but our entertainment district has developed unhealthy characteristics.<p>A healthy downtown is one where people are eager to live, work, play, and invest.</p>I would like for the places we are seeking to attract visitors not to repel locals.</span></div><div></div><div><p><span><a>Freddie O'Connell</a><span>(Nonpartisan)</span></p></div><div><span>I appreciate that we have moved beyond policing. See above for other thoughts. I will keep intact most of the programs of the current Office of Community Safety. I would also like to continue recovering from harms of previous policies that caused unjust mass incarceration, particularly in the 37208 zip code. A recent fines and fees study gave us a roadmap that we've made great progress on, but we have more work to do.</span></div><div></div><div><p><span><a>Freddie O'Connell</a><span>(Nonpartisan)</span></p></div><div><span>We will need to revisit the relationship between our police department and our community oversight board, which was changed by state preemption.
